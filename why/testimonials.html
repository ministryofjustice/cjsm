						<h3>The Criminal Justice Organisations</h3>
						<p><img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_start.gif" alt="open quote" />The information we received by fax could be illegible, because it was handwritten. Sometimes we never received it at all, because faxing can be unreliable. Now, using CJSM, we receive this information instantaneously, and because it is on a standard form, it is easier to read and input onto our own CREST system. This saves us a lot of time. The other benefit is that the CJSM system provides an automatic feedback to the Magistrates' Court if we do not receive or read the email, so they know if there is a problem with transmission.<img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_end.gif" alt="end quote" /></p>

						<p><img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_start.gif" alt="open quote" />We've gone from no correspondence by email to sending and receiving about 70% of our business and general enquiry transactions with our CJS partners using email.</p>
						<p>it&#8217;s helped us meet our obligations for resulting with victim and witness service and with PNC bureau.</p>
						<p>We email results to police and CPS witness care units....without CJSM we wouldn't be able to meet our obligations for 99% of the time.</p>
						<p>We used to copy record sheets five times but now we only do one....we achieved substantial savings in staff time and running costs.<img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_end.gif" alt="end quote" /></p>

						<h3>The Crime Reduction Partnership</h3>
						<p><img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_start.gif" alt="open quote" />In my role as Co-ordinator for the Craven Crime Reduction Partnership, I often required access to sensitive material.</p>
						<p>Located within a small Local Authority environment, there were some difficulties in acquiring such sensitive material over the authorities email system, which of course was not secure.</p>
						<p>Having looked at several options, I concluded that the only viable and least expensive system available to me was OCJR's CJSM system.</p>
						<p>Acquiring such a system could not have been easier; it was a matter of completing a small application form and returning it to the OCJR office.</p>
						<p>Before very long I was contacted by letter, advising me of some small inputs required into my computer and from that gained access to the system. Any technical issues I did not understand were dealt with via the help line in a most helpful and understanding manner.</p>
						<p>I now receive all my CJSMs without difficulty.<img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_end.gif" alt="end quote" /></p>

						<h3>The Local Authority</h3>
						<p><img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_start.gif" alt="open quote" />We first signed up for CJSM in Autumn 2004, and we're keen to use it in as many areas as possible where secure, recordable, communications are appropriate. When you send something over CJSM, it&#8217;s much closer to being a secure and repeatable process than if you send it over fax. And that can only be a good thing for all users.</p>
						<p>And all parties benefit.  From the Courts' point of view, for example, using CJSM means that they would be more likely to get Pre-Sentencing Reports on time, as opposed to having them delivered late, with all the additional costs to the courts that that entails.  We are working to use CJSM in all appropriate communications with the Courts, and with the Probation Service and other criminal justice organisations. We are also increasingly using CJSM for our communications with the Metropolitan Police on issues related to child protection.</p>
						<p>We have found that the system works extremely well, and we haven't had any problems with signing up for it. What issues there are have been were primarily to do with changing the way people work, to encourage them to start using CJSM more.<img class="start-quote" src="../images/quote_large_end.gif" alt="end quote" /></p>

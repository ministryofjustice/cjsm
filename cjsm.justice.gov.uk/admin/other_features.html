						<h3>SMTP features:</h3>
						<p>We've added a number of new features which should make it easier for organisation administrators with SMTP accounts to perform their functions and help to keep the CJSM service safe, secure and efficient.</p>

						<h4>Multiple details change in CJSM Directory</h4>

						<p>You can change the details that appear in the CJSM Directory for several users within your organisation at once. This is particularly useful if, for example, you move offices, or get a new telephone number.</p>

						<h4>Create SMTP / Government Secure Community user account</h4>

						<p>If your organisation has an SMTP or Government Secure Community Account, you can create additional accounts for new users. The system will generate a username, one-time password and CJSM address for each new user, and even offer to generate a letter than can be sent to them containing their account details, username and one-time password. The CJSM address for that user will be the original non-CJSM address, with 'cjsm.net' appended to the end of it.</p>

						<h4>Bulk add users</h4>

						<p>You can add up to 500 users at a time to your organisation's CJSM account. If your organisation has a mailbox account, a user name and one-time password will be generated for each new user. The users will have to change their one-time password the first time they use it to log in. They will also be asked to provide three pieces of security information, such as their mother's maiden name, the first school them went to and where they were born, so that they can be authenticated in the future.</p>

						<h4>User password reset</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you will be able to reset a user's password to a one-time password. All you have to do is authenticate the user by asking them for certain details, generated by the system, of their security data. You will then be given a one-time password, which the user will be invited to change the first time they use it to log in.</p>

						<h4>Authenticate User</h4>

						<p>If you need to verify a user's identity, for example to reset their password, you can follow a simple authentication procedure. The system will randomly select letters from the users' security information for you to ask them, for example: 'what's the second letter of your mother's maiden name?' You can't see the security information itself, but when you enter the letters requested by the system, you will be told if the user has answered correctly or not.</p>

						<h4>Multiple status change</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you can change the status of several users within your organisation all at once. The different actions you can take are:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Suspend users</li>
							<li>Unsuspend users</li>
							<li>Delete users</li>
							<li>Undelete users</li>
							<li>Unlock users' accounts</li>
							<li>Mark/Unmark users as ex-directory</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Mark users within the organisation as 'ex directory'</h4>

						<p>You can mark a user in your organisation as ex-directory. Their details will not be available to normal users searching the CJSM Directory.</p>

						<h4>Self suspension</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you will be able suspend your own organisation, for example, if you know that your internet connection or email server is or will be unavailable for a significant period of time.</p>

						<p>Any CJSMs sent to users in your organisation while the account is suspended will be returned to the sender, and they will be advised to contact you another way until further notice.</p>

						<h4>Administration person search results</h4>

						<p>The 'search' function on the site lets users find the details of any other CJSM user. As an organisation administrator, the results you see will also show the current status of users in your organisation. You can even search for users in your own organisation by account status, for example, if you wanted to find all suspended users.</p>

						<p>You can then choose to carry out an action in respect of one or more of the users shown in the results.</p>

						<h4>Create a distribution list</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you can create and edit distribution lists. This is useful if users have to write emails to the same group of people regularly, as it saves them having to enter their email addresses individually each time.</p>

						<p>You can include any user of CJSM in the list, even if they work for another organisation. The list will then appear in the CJSM Directory and can be saved into the user's personal address book.</p>

						<p>If a user is a member of a distribution list, they will receive emails into their own inbox.</p>

						<h4>Reset users</h4>

						<p>This new feature will allow organisation administrators to reset a user's details, when the user has either been locked out before they have even activated their account, or they have forgotten or miss-typed their memorable data and can't authenticate themselves. This new functionality will be tightly controlled. For more details, see our <a href="../downloads/Exceptional_Access_Policy.doc" title="Exceptional Access Policy">Exceptional Access Policy</a>.</p>

					<a href="#top" title="Top" class="functional-link">top</a>

					<div class="content-single-column-dotted">
						<a name="webmail_features" title="Webmail_features"></a>
						<h3>Webmail features:</h3>
						<p>We've added a number of new features which should make it easier for organisation administrators for webmail accounts to perform their functions and help to keep the CJSM service safe, secure and efficient.</p>

						<h4>Multiple details change in CJSM Directory</h4>

						<p>You can change the details that appear in the CJSM Directory for several users within your organisation at once. This is particularly useful if, for example, you move offices, or get a new telephone number.</p>

						<h4>Create mailbox user account</h4>

						<p>If your organisation has a mailbox account, you can create additional accounts for new users. The system will generate a username and one-time password for each new user, and offer to generate a letter that can be sent to them containing their account details, username and one-time password.</p>

						<p>Please note: We have changed the format for email addresses for mailbox users. Previously, they were like this: peterpan-org@cjsm.net, but now they have been changed to the following: peter.pan@org.cjsm.net</p>

						<p>The old-style addresses will stay in existence as long as they are needed. Existing users will be automatically assigned with a new-style email, but it is up to them if they want to publicise it or use it.</p>

						<p>However, all new users, regardless of whether they are from a new or an existing organisation will only be able to have a new-style email address.</p>

						<h4>Bulk add users</h4>

						<p>You can add up to 500 users at a time to your organisation's CJSM account. If your organisation has a mailbox account, a user name and one-time password will be generated for each new user. The users will have to change their one-time password the first time they use it to log in. They will also be asked to provide three pieces of security information, such as their mother's maiden name, the first school them went to and where they were born, so that they can be authenticated in the future.</p>

						<h4>User password reset</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you will be able to reset a user's password to a one-time password. All you have to do is authenticate the user by asking them for certain details, generated by the system, of their security data. You will then be given a one-time password, which the user will be invited to change the first time they use it to log in.</p>

						<h4>Authenticate User</h4>

						<p>If you need to verify a user's identity, for example to reset their password, you can follow a simple authentication procedure. The system will randomly select letters from the users' security information for you to ask them, for example: 'what's the second letter of your mother's maiden name?' You can't see the security information itself, but when you enter the letters requested by the system, you will be told if the user has answered correctly or not.</p>

						<h4>Inactive mailbox alert</h4>

						<p>You will receive an email alert if a mailbox in your organisation's account hasn't been used for six months.</p>

						<h4>Multiple status change</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you can change the status of several users within your organisation all at once.  The different actions you can take are:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Suspend users</li>
							<li>Unsuspend users</li>
							<li>Delete users</li>
							<li>Undelete users</li>
							<li>Unlock users' accounts</li>
							<li>Mark/Unmark users as ex-directory</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Access to users' mailboxes</h4>

						<p>Under exceptional circumstances, you may be granted access to the account of a user within your organisation. You may need to do this if, for example, a user is away from work for an extended period due to illness, or is suddenly removed from employment.</p>

						<p>However, you will have to speak to a CJSM Administrator and satisfy them that access is absolutely necessary.</p>

						<h4>Undelete deleted mailboxes</h4>

						<p>You will be able to undelete a user's mailbox for 30 days after it is deleted. During this period, all mail sent to the deleted account will be returned to the sender.  After the 30-day period the account and its contents will be deleted.</p>

						<h4>Change CJSM address</h4>

						<p>You will be able to change a user's CJSM address and last name, for example if the user gets married.</p>

						<h4>Mark users within the organisation as 'ex directory'</h4>

						<p>You can mark a user in your organisation as ex-directory. Their details will not be available to normal users searching the CJSM Directory.</p>

						<h4>Self suspension</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you will be able suspend your own organisation, for example, if you know that your internet connection or email server is or will be unavailable for a significant period of time.</p>

						<p>Any CJSMs sent to users in your organisation while the account is suspended will be returned to the sender, and they will be advised to contact you another way until further notice.</p>

						<h4>Administration person search results</h4>

						<p>The 'search' function on the site lets users find the details of any other CJSM user. As an organisation administrator, the results you see will also show the current status of users in your organisation. You can even search for users in your own organisation by account status, for example, if you wanted to find all suspended users.</p>

						<p>You can then choose to carry out an action in respect of one or more of the users shown in the results.</p>

						<h4>Create group mailboxes</h4>

						<p>If your organisation has a mailbox account, as the organisation administrator you can set up group mailboxes. A group mailbox is a separate mailbox account with its own email address, which can be accessed by more than one user, as long as they have the correct permission.</p>

						<p>Users can be given different permissions with respect to a group mailbox. 'Read' access will enable them to view and open email messages in the group mailbox. 'Write' access will enable them to move/copy new email messages into the group mailbox. Lastly, 'mail' access will enable them to send emails within the group.</p>

						<p>Please note, if your organisation has an SMTP CJSM account, you won't be able to set up Group Mailboxes through your local mail system.</p>

						<h4>Create a distribution list</h4>

						<p>As an organisation administrator, you can create and edit distribution lists. This is useful if users have to write emails to the same group of people regularly, as it saves them having to enter their email addresses individually each time.</p>

						<p>You can include any user of CJSM in the list, even if they work for another organisation. The list will then appear in the CJSM Directory and can be saved into the user's personal address book.</p>

						<p>If a user is a member of a distribution list, they will receive emails into their own inbox.</p>

						<h4>Reset users</h4>

						<p>This new feature will allow organisation administrators to reset a user's details, when the user has either been locked out before they have even activated their account, or they have forgotten or miss-typed their memorable data and can't authenticate themselves. This new functionality will be tightly controlled.
